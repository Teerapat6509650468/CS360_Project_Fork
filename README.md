## Unit and Integration Testing Overview
Our team uses the following tools for testing :
- **Jest**: Used for unit testing individual functions or modules, ensuring that each component works as expected in isolation.
- **Supertest**: Handles integration testing, focusing on how different parts of the application interact, especially useful for testing API endpoints.
- **Babel**: Transpiles ES6+ JavaScript code to ensure compatibility with Jest, allowing the use of modern JavaScript features in tests.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates testing in CI/CD. Each push and pull request triggers the GitHub Actions workflow, running our test suite in various environments (e.g., macos-latest, ubuntu-24.04). This setup ensures consistent test results across platforms and notifies us immediately if any tests fail, providing valuable feedback on code quality before merging.


## Setting Up Tests

- For local, to set up the testing environment, make sure you have Yarn installed. Then, install the required packages by running:
	1. Install denpendency for frontend
    ```bash
    yarn 
    ```
	2. Install denpendency for backend
    ```bash
    cd backend/
    yarn 
    ```
	3. Create or modify the .env file:
	- Run the deploy-script.sh script to set up the environment, or
	- Generate a secret key manually with:
     ``` bash
     openssl rand -base64 32
     ```
- for the CI pipeline ensure to setting up GitHub secret first:
  1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
  2. Navigate to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions.
  3. Click New repository secret.
  4. Provide a name (e.g., `APP_KEYS`, `API_TOKEN_SALT`, `ADMIN_JWT_SECRET`, `TRANSFER_TOKEN_SALT`, `JWT_SECRET`) and value (the secret data itself).
  5. Save the secret.
  6. The names of the secrets are case-sensitive, so ensure consistency in naming when referring to them in workflows.

- In our project, the CI pipeline automatically runs whenever code is updated (through push or pull requests) in every branch and follows these steps:

    1. **Trigger (on:)**  
       The pipeline automatically runs on any `push` or `pull_request` event to any branch (`'*'`). This ensures the workflow is triggered for all updates across branches.

    2. **Job Setup (Run-Test-Suite)**  
       - The job is configured to run on different operating systems using a matrix strategy (`ubuntu-24.04`, `windows-latest`, `macos-latest`), ensuring compatibility across environments. Different Node.js versions (`16.x`, `22.x`, and `node`) are also tested, ensuring the code runs smoothly on multiple versions of Node.js.
       - fail-fast: false lets all matrix combinations run, even if one fails, providing complete test results.

    3. **Steps**:
        - **System Information**:
            - `echo "This job is now running on a ${{ matrix.os }}"` outputs the OS currently in use for easier debugging and identification.
            - Displays the branch name and repository using `echo`, showing contextual information for the test.
        
        - **Checkout Code**:  
          Uses `actions/checkout@v4` to pull the latest code from the repository into the runner environment, ensuring the job has the most recent code.
        
        - **Setup Node.js**:  
          - Installs Node.js on the runner according to the specified `matrix.node-version`. The `cache: 'npm'` option is used to save previously downloaded packages and speed up future runs.
        
        - **List Repository Files**:  
          - Lists all files in the repository with `ls`, helping confirm that the code is available and accessible for subsequent steps.
        
        - **Install Dependencies**:  
          - Runs `npm install` to install all project dependencies as specified in `package-lock.json`, ensuring consistent dependency versions.
          - Installs project dependencies in the root for frontend and then specifically in the ./backend folder for backend.
            
        - **Environment Setup for Backend**:  
          - Creating a .env file within the ./backend folder and securely injecting secret environment variables from GitHub secret for Strapi API authentication, tokens, and other sensitive keys is essential for maintaining security and functionality.
            
        - **Run Test Suite**:  
          - Runs `npm test` to execute the automated tests.
          - The environment variables (`APP_KEYS`, `API_TOKEN_SALT`, `ADMIN_JWT_SECRET`, `TRANSFER_TOKEN_SALT`, `JWT_SECRET`) are set using GitHub secrets, securely providing necessary values for tests.
        
        - **If tests fail**, an error is logged specifying which tests failed on each OS and Node.js version.
        
        - **Display Job Status**:  
          - Logs the job’s final status (e.g., success or failure) using `echo`, providing a summary of the job outcome for easier troubleshooting.


## Running Tests
- **Running Tests Locally**: Run tests locally with these commands:

```bash
#unit test
npm test
```

```bash
#integration test
cd backend/
npm test
```

- **CI Pipeline Process**:
  1. Every time there’s a push or pull request to any branch (indicated by '*' in the `test-suite.yml` file), the pipeline triggers automatically.
  2. GitHub Actions starts running the Run-Test-Suite job, following each step in sequence: checking out code, setting up the environment, installing dependencies, and running the test suite.
  3. The matrix strategy makes the pipeline test the code across multiple operating systems and Node.js versions, as specified, to confirm compatibility across all environments.

### 2. Viewing Test Results in Terminal (Local Testing)
   - **Run Tests Locally**:
     - Run tests with the command:
```bash
#unit test
npm test
```

```bash
#integration test
cd backend/
npm test
```

     - Results will appear in the terminal in real-time.

   - **Test Results**:
     - The terminal shows detailed results, including:
       - Number of tests passed and failed
       - Time taken per test
       - Error details for any failed assertions
         
   - **Summary**:
     - At the end, the terminal provides a summary, such as `Tests: 10 passed, 2 failed`, giving an overview of the test outcomes.

## Adding New Tests

Add new test files within the `src/__test__` directory, following these steps:

1. **Create Test Files**:
   - For **unit tests**, add files under `src/__test__/`.
   - For **integration tests**, place files under `backend/tests/`.
   - Each test file should follow a naming convention that reflects its purpose. For example:
     - `AAA.test.js` for unit tests.
     - `BBB.test.js` for integration tests.

2. **Write Test Cases**:
   - Define test cases that validate specific functions, components, or API endpoints.
    - Use Jest’s `describe` and `it` functions to organize tests for unit testing.
   - For integration tests with Supertest.

3. **Run Tests Locally**:
   - Ensure that new tests pass locally by running:
     
```bash
#unit test
yarn
npm test
```
```bash
#integration test
cd backend/
yarn
npm test
```

4. **Commit and Push**:
   - After validating new tests locally, select the branch associated with the new test (e.g., `sprint2-unit-test`).
   - Commit and push the code to trigger CI tests in GitHub Actions. This will run the test suite across different environments, reinforcing compatibility and quality.
 
5. **Review Test Results**:
   - Monitor the GitHub Actions workflow to confirm that all tests pass.
  
6. **Merge to Main Branch**:
   - After ensuring that all tests pass successfully, you can merge your branch into the main branch.
